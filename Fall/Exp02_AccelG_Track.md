# Background

By measuring the acceleration of a mass moving under the influence of
the gravitational attraction of the earth, namely its weight, we can
determine the acceleration due to gravity, usually denoted by *g*. The
mass will be allowed to accelerate down a presumed frictionless,
inclined plane. Measurement of the acceleration along the plane is
directly related to the acceleration due to gravity by a simple
trigonometric relationship. The use of the plane permits the convenient
measurement of a small, measurable fraction of the acceleration due to
gravity. This of course is in lieu of the much more difficult
measurement of a vertically falling mass.

Near the surface of the earth, the attractive force of the earth on a
mass can be considered a constant over a reasonable range of elevation.
This force is commonly called the weight of the object and from Newton’s
Second Law the weight is the mass, *m*, times the acceleration due to
gravity. Using Fig. <a href="#M02Fig01" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="M02Fig01">1</a>. and the derivation following, we can
see that the value of *g* can be easily determined by a few simple
measurements.

The displacement along the track is *S* and the component of
acceleration *a*<sub>*s*</sub> along the track is
$$a_s = \\frac{F_s}{m} = \\frac{m g \\sin(\\theta)}{m} =  g \\sin(\\theta).$$
If the mass is released from rest near the top of the inclined air track
and allowed to accelerate down the air track with a magnitude
*a*<sub>*s*</sub>, then by measuring the transit time down the track
over a measurable distance, *S*, we can determine the value of *g*.

Since the acceleration *a*<sub>*s*</sub> is constant, the displacement
*S* as a function of time *t* is:
$$S = \\frac{1}{2} a t^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g t^{2} \\sin(\\theta).$$
Solving for *g*, we obtain
$$g = \\frac{2 S}{t^2 \\sin(\\theta)}.$$

If we assume that the incline angle *θ* is small, we can approximate the
sin (*θ*) by the $\\tan(\\theta) = \\nicefrac{H}{D}$. Making this
substitution for the sin (*θ*), we have the value of *g* in terms of
easily measurable quantities, namely
$$\\label{eq:M02gvalue}
  g = \\frac{2 S D}{H t^2}$$
where *H* is the vertical rise in the horizontal distance *D*. *D* is
the distance between the legs of the air track, and *t* is the transit
time of the mass, starting from zero velocity and accelerating down the
plane a distance *S* along the plane. We will compare our results to the
measured value of *g* at sea level. The value at sea level at New York
is $g = 9.803\\,\\meter\\per\\second\\squared$.

In the experiment, the presumed frictionless inclined plane will be an
air track. The mass will be a glider, which floats on the air track.
Placing a spacer of height *H* under the leg at one end of the track,
which is a distance *D* from the leg(s) at the opposite end, will
incline the track. Refer to

section.

In this experiment you will measure the motion of a glider down a tilted
track using PASCO photogates (stated precision of 0.0001 seconds)
connected to PASCO’s data logging and visualization software,
**Capstone**, which will be set up as a timer for this experiment.

1.  ***Do not put a glider on the track without air flowing.***

2.  Create a table of the common data including the masses of the
    gliders, the distance *D* between the legs of the air track and the
    heights of the two spacers.

3.  Measure and record the mass of both the large and small glider.

4.  Without the spacer present and the air track resting directly on the
    tabletop (with the black circle feet), place one of the gliders on
    the track and note any preferential drift of the glider. Adjust the
    height of the single leg (screw in or out) until the air track is
    level, as indicated by no preferential drift. Check both
    orientations of the glider on the track to check if the car is
    asymmetric and has a significant preferential drift on an otherwise
    level track. If this occurs, use another glider.

5.  Measure and record the distance *D*. This is the center-to-center
    distance between the legs.

6.  Measure and record the heights, *H*, of each of the two spacers with
    the provided Vernier caliper for greater precision.

7.  Four cases will be performed with a tilted air track, two gliders
    with two spacers (e.g. BIG spacer/small glider, BIG spacer/BIG
    glider, small spacer/small glider, small spacer/BIG glider).

8.  Determine a convenient point on the glider to use with the scale
    attached on the side of track. It doesn’t matter what point you
    choose, only that you use the same point for all determinations of
    *Δ**s* for that glider. A convenient point is the lower front or
    rear corner of the glider since it will be very close or overlapping
    with the length scale on the track itself.

9.  For each of the four cases, perform the following steps and record
    the data appropriately in your spreadsheet:

    1.  For each of the four cases with a tilted track create enough
        **rows** for the number of trials you are doing, and **columns**
        for each of the variables you will be measuring or deriving:

        -   starting point at the top *s*<sub>1</sub>

        -   stopping point at the bottom *s*<sub>0</sub>

        -   distance between the photogates that the glider travels *S*

        -   start time at the top *t*<sub>1</sub>

        -   time at the bottom *t*<sub>0</sub>

        -   time between the photogates *Δ**t*

        -   calculated value of *g* using
            Eqn. <a href="#eq:M02gvalue" data-reference-type="ref"
            data-reference="eq:M02gvalue">[eq:M02gvalue]</a> for each of
            the five trials

        -   average value of *g* from the five trials of each case

        -   standard deviation of *g* from the five trials of each case

        -   difference between the average value of *g* and the accepted
            value of $9.803\\,\\meter\\per\\second\\squared$ for
            Fairfield, CT for each case

        -   similarly, the average, standard deviation, and difference
            for *g* from all 20 trials across all 4 cases

    2.  Raise the single leg side of the track by placing a spacer under
        the knob.

    3.  Place the glider near the bottom of the track. Move it slowly as
        you approach the bottom photogate. Stop the glider at the exact
        location when the photogate’s red light comes on. Record
        position on the scale, *s*<sub>0</sub>.

    4.  Next, place the glider near the top of the track. Move it slowly
        as you approach the top photogate. Stop the glider at the exact
        location when the photogate’s red light comes on. Record
        position on the scale, *s*<sub>1</sub>.

    5.  Before you take the recorded data in the next step, take some
        practice runs. Your subsequent data will be much improved by
        your training! Press record in **Capstone** to start the timer.
        *NOTE:* **Capstone** will display the time whenever a photogate
        beam is broken; the time at the higher (start) photogate
        *t*<sub>1</sub> as well as the time at the lower (end) photogate
        *t*<sub>0</sub>. To determine the total transit time *Δ**t*,
        take the difference of the start and end times.

    6.  Position the glider so it is blocking the top photogate and the
        red light is on. Place one finger on the track in front of the
        glider and gently move the glider up the track (to the right)
        until the red light on the photogate just goes out.

    7.  Release the glider by quickly pulling your finger away from the
        track and glider (MINIMIZE ANY FINGER CONTACT WITH THE GLIDER to
        minimize any additional push or pull on the glider to **ensure
        its initial velocity is zero**).

    8.  For each of the **5 trials per case**, release the glider from
        rest at the *s*<sub>1</sub> position. Measure and record the
        start time *t*<sub>1</sub> and end time *t*<sub>1</sub> to
        determine transit time *Δ**t* from release at the top to bottom
        of the airtrack. Calculate the value of *g* for this trial.

10. For each the four cases:

    -   Calculate the average of the measured *g*

    -   Calculate the standard deviation of the measured *g*

    -   Calculate the differences between your average *g* and the
        accepted value of *g*

11. Also, using data from all trials from all the cases:

    -   Calculate the average of the measured *g*.

    -   Calculate the standard deviation of the measured *g*.

    -   Calculate the differences between your average *g* and the
        accepted value of *g*

# Post-Lab Submission — Interpretation of Results

-   Make sure to submit your finalized data table (Excel sheet)

-   If you release the glider higher above the photogate rather than
    right at the gate, what would you expect to happen to your derived
    values of *g*?

-   What are sources of uncertainty (initial v, friction, etc.)?

-   What was the precision of the instrumentation (e.g. caliper, time,
    distance, etc.)?

-   Compare your results (*g* from each of the four cases and one from
    all 20 trials) to the accepted value. How do the standard deviations
    compare to the difference between your values of *g* and the
    accepted value of *g*? I.e. while treating the standard deviations
    of your measurements as your measurement uncertainties, do your
    values of *g* for each case, as well as the overall average *g*,
    plus or minus the standard deviations overlap (and agree) with the
    accepted value of *g*? What might cause your results to disagree the
    most?

-   Suppose there is a frictional force slowing the glider as it moves
    along the track. How would this affect the determined value of *g*?
    Would your result support or not support the hypothesis of that
    there is significant friction along the track?

-   Assume the track is not level at the beginning of the experiment.
    Further, assume that what you thought to be a level track was in
    fact slightly tipped in the same direction as your deliberate
    tipping via the spacers during the experiment. How would this affect
    the determined value of *g*? Would your result support or not
    support the hypothesis of the track not being level?
