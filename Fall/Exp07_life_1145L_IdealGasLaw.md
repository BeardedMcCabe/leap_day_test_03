# Background

A general and complete description of an ensemble of many atoms or
molecules is a very difficult, if not impossible task, given the large
number of objects involved. Luckily enough most gases follow a
relatively simple approximation for a rather large range of conditions.

The ideal gas law describes the behavior of a gas of point-like
particles. While there is no such thing as an ideal gas (all real
molecules have a small but non-zero size), it is nevertheless a good
approximation to the behaviour of gasses at ordinary temperatures and
pressures.

## Ideal Gas Law

The Ideal Gas Law assumes that

-   The gas is made up of molecules moving in straight lines, but random
    directions,

-   All collisions between the molecules themselves and between the
    molecules and the walls of the container are perfectly elastic,

-   The temperature of the gas is directly proportional to the kinetic
    energy of the molecules,

-   The pressure of the gas is due to the collisions of the molecules
    with the walls of the container,

-   All inter-molecular forces can be neglected, and

-   The volume occupied by the molecules is negligible as compared to
    the volume of the container.

Under these conditions the pressure, temperature, and volume of the gas
will follow a simple relationship,
*P**V* = *n**R**T*
where *P* is the gas pressure in Pascals
($1\\,\\pascal = 1\\,\\newton\\per\\metre\\squared$), *T* is the gas
temperature in Kelvin, *V* is the volume (in ), and *n* is the number of
moles in the gas
($1\\,\\mole = 6.022\\times10^{23}\\,\\mbox{molecules}$). *R* is called
the universal gas constant and for these units has the value
$R = 8.3145\\,\\joule\\per\\mole\\per\\kelvin$.

Most gases will behave approximately as an ideal gas within a certain
range of conditions, but the law fails at low temperatures or higher
pressures when forces between the gas molecules become important.

## Absolute Zero

One of the things the ideal gas law assumes is that the kinetic energy
of the gas molecules is directly proportional to the temperature of the
gas. Therefore, if the molecules have no kinetic energy (the molecules
are at rest) then the temperature of the gas is at its lowest possible
value. This temperature is called absolute zero and is used as the
zero-point of the Kelvin temperature scale
$$0\\,\\kelvin = -273.15\\,\\celsius.$$
Note that, according to the definition of pressure, gas molecules at
absolute zero will also exert no pressure on the walls of the container
the gas is in.

# Experimental Procedure

This experiment uses temperature and pressure sensors plugged into an
interface so that data for both variables can be recorded
simultaneously. For the Ideal Gas Law experiment the air inside a
syringe is compressed by pushing on the plunger. Pressure and
temperature values are collected and recorded with the Capstone program,
which is then also used to analyze the data. See
page <a href="#sec:SettingUpHardware" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:SettingUpHardware">[sec:SettingUpHardware]</a> for
guidance. For the Absolute Zero experiment a hollow sphere (with a fixed
volume) is submerged in liquids of different temperature. Capstone will
again collect and record pressure and temperature data of the gas
enclosed in the sphere. Pictures of the experimental setups are shown in
Figures <a href="#H01Fig01" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="H01Fig01">[H01Fig01]</a> and

## The Ideal Gas Law Experiment

-   Create a Part 1 Data Table for your ideal gas law measurements and
    calculations.

-   Open graphs of absolute pressure (*y*-axis) vs. time (*x*-axis) and
    temperature in Kelvin (*y*-axis) vs. time (*x*-axis) in the
    **Capstone** program. Also have a table displaying absolute pressure
    and temperature open. All these can be opened by double-clicking on
    the corresponding items on the right-had side of the **Capstone**
    program.

-   Disconnect the quick-release pressure connector and push the plunger
    all the way down. Note that the mechanical stop will prevent the
    plunger from being pushed all the way to the bottom of the syringe.
    Record the volume reading on the syringe as the volume
    *V*<sub>2</sub> in your Part 1 Data Table. The value for
    *V*<sub>2</sub> should be about 20 cc.

-   Set the plunger for an initial volume of
    $V\_{1} = 40\\,\\centi\\meter\\cubed$.

-   After you have adjusted the volume, re-connect the pressure port.

-   Hold the base of the syringe firmly against a sturdy, flat surface
    (the lab table).

-   Press the **Record** button on **Capstone**.

-   Press straight down as hard as you can on the plunger with the palm
    of your hand to fully compress the gas inside the syringe. Keep
    pressing to hold the pressure steady. Important: Do not let the
    pressure drop for at least 30 s. The mechanical stop will prevent
    you from decreasing the volume of the gas to less than than about
    20 cc. Hold this position until the temperature and pressure have
    stabilized and are no longer changing (use the data table as an
    indicator). It should take less than 30 seconds for the temperature
    to return to room temperature.

-   Release the plunger and allow it to expand back out on its own (it
    may not go back to 40 ). Wait again until the temperature and
    pressure have equalized and are no longer changing.

-   Press the **Record** button again on **Capstone** to stop recording
    data.

### Analysis with Constant Temperature

-   Highlight an area (click and drag with the mouse) on the pressure
    graph at the beginning of the data-collecting run, before you
    compressed the air in the syringe. The highlighted values of the
    selected data points will appear in the data table of **Captone**.
    Record the initial pressure as *P*<sub>1</sub> in your Part 1 Data
    Table.

-   Highlight an area on the pressure graph at the point just before you
    released the plunger. Record the final pressure as *P*<sub>2</sub>
    in your Part 1 Data Table.

-   Calculate the ratio of initial volume over the final volume,
    $X\_{1} = \\nicefrac{V\_{1}}{V\_{2}}$ and record the result in your
    Part 1 Data Table.

-   Calculate the ratio of final pressure over the initial pressure,
    $X\_{2} = \\nicefrac{P\_{2}}{P\_{1}}$ and record the result in your
    Part 1 Data Table.

-   Compare the two ratios. According to the ideal gas law
    (Eqn. <a href="#eq:idealgas" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="eq:idealgas">[eq:idealgas]</a>) the two values
    should be equal, since
    *P*<sub>1</sub>*V*<sub>1</sub> = *P*<sub>2</sub>*V*<sub>2</sub> for
    constant temperature (note that the temperature is room temperature
    in both cases). Discuss, first amongst yourselves and then with your
    instructor, why the values are different.

### Analysis with Varying Temperature

By now you have (hopefully) figured out that you have not accounted for
the small amount of volume of air inside the tubing of the apparatus.
Using the ideal gas law
(Eqn. <a href="#eq:idealgas" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:idealgas">[eq:idealgas]</a>) and the data you
collected in part 1 you can actually calculate this volume
*V*<sub>0</sub> by solving the following equation for *V*<sub>0</sub>
$$\\frac{(V\_{1} + V\_{0})}{(V\_{2} + V\_{0})} = \\frac{P\_{2}}{P\_{1}}.$$

Using the data from your Part 1 Data Table calculate the value for
*V*<sub>0</sub> and note the result in your Part 2 Data Table.

-   Highlight an area (click and drag with the mouse) on the temperature
    graph at the beginning of the data-collecting run, before you
    compressed the air in the syringe. The highlighted values of the
    selected data points will appear in the data table of **Capstone**.
    Record the initial pressure and the initial temperature as
    *P*<sub>1</sub> and *T*<sub>1</sub> in your Part 2 Data Table.

-   Note the initial volume
    *V*<sub>1</sub><sup>′</sup> = *V*<sub>1</sub> + *V*<sub>0</sub> in
    your Part 2 Data Table.

-   Highlight the area (click and drag with the mouse) on the
    temperature graph where the temperature peaks. The highlighted
    values of the selected data points will appear in the data table of
    **Capstone**. Note the peak temperature and the corresponding
    pressure at this instant as *P*<sub>2</sub> and *T*<sub>2</sub> in
    your Part 2 Data Table.

-   Note the volume
    *V*<sub>2</sub><sup>′</sup> = *V*<sub>2</sub> + *V*<sub>0</sub> in
    your Part 2 Data Table.

-   Calculate the ratio
    $Y\_{1} = \\nicefrac{P\_{1} V\_{1}^\\prime}{T\_{1}}$ and record the
    result in your Part 2 Data Table.

-   Calculate the ratio
    $Y\_{2} = \\nicefrac{P\_{2} V\_{2}^\\prime}{T\_{2}}$ and record the
    result in your Part 2 Data Table.

-   Assuming the most significant error is in the volume, compare the
    difference between the two ratios with your estimate of the
    uncertainty in the volume.

## Measurement of Absolute Zero

-   Connect the Absolute Zero apparatus to the PasPort system (both the
    temperature sensor and the quick-release pressure port need to be
    connected).

-   Close the **Capstone** Program and re-open it from the desktop.

-   Open a **Table & Graph** from the main canvas of **Capstone**. For
    the *x*-axis of the graph select absolute pressure and for the
    *y*-axis select temperature in . For the data table select the same
    two variables.

-   Now click on the **Continuous Mode** and select **Keep mode** from
    the pull-down menu that will appear. Click on the **Preview** button
    to start collecting data.

-   Run the hot water until steam rises from the sink. Fill a pitcher to
    the 2 quart mark.

-   First fully submerge the sphere in hot water: Observe the data
    points appearing on the graph. Make sure the sphere stays completely
    submerged the entire time you take data. Once the temperature has
    reached equilibrium (i.e. the value in the digital display no longer
    changes), press the **Keep Sample** button (N.B. Do **NOT** stop the
    data collection by clicking on the red square button again). Read
    and note the values for pressure and temperature (from the digital
    display) in your Part 3 Data Table.

-   Next remove half of the water in your container and replace it with
    cold water from the sink. Again fully submerge the sphere in the
    water and make sure the sphere stays completely submerged the entire
    time you take data. Note how the point moves in the Temperature vs.
    Pressure graph as the values change. Discuss the outcome among
    yourselves and with your instructor. Once the temperature is stable
    again (this will take a few minutes) press the **Keep Sample**
    button again. Read off and note the values for pressure and
    temperature (from the digital display) in your Part 3 Data Table.

-   Lastl submerge the sphere in the cold water. Once again you need to
    make sure the sphere is completely submerged during the time you
    take data. Note how the point moves in the Temperature vs. Pressure
    graph as the values change. Discuss the outcome among yourselves and
    with your instructor. Once the temperature is stable again (this
    will take a few minutes) press the **Keep Sample** button again.
    Read off and note the values for pressure and temperature in your
    Part 3 Data Table.

-   Press the **Record** button once again on DataStudio to stop
    recording data.

-   Using the fitting tool in **Capstone**, fit a straight line to the 3
    data points you have taken.

-   The *y*-intercept of the best-fit line is the value for absolute
    zero temperature. Discuss among yourselves and with your instructor
    why this is the case. Note the result as *T*<sub>0</sub> in your
    Part 2 Data Table.

-   Compare your result to the accepted value of $-273.15\\,\\celsius$.
