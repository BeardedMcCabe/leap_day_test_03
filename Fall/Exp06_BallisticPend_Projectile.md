# Background

Conservation of energy and linear momentum will be used to measure the
initial velocity of a projectile. Two techniques will be employed.

In the first, a ballistic pendulum, a device designed to capture a
projectile in an initially stationary pendulum, will be used. The
conservation principles are used to analyze the collision and the
subsequent motion of the pendulum. The completely inelastic collision
associated with the capture of the projectile in the pendulum and the
subsequent motion of the pendulum provide the data necessary for the
determination of the initial velocity.

In the second technique, the measured parameters of the trajectory of a
horizontally launched projectile are used to determine the initial
velocity. With the projectile moving in a free-fall trajectory, constant
acceleration kinematics will be used to determine the initial velocity
from measurements of the horizontal range and vertical drop.

In each case, the projectile will be launched with the same device
allowing a comparison of the initial velocity determinations of the two
techniques.

## Ballistic Pendulum

The ballistic pendulum is so named because it was originally used to
measure the velocity of high-speed projectiles such as bullets long
before electric and electronic timers made the procedure unnecessary. It
remains, however, as a simple and demonstrative device for understanding
the conservation principles of energy and momentum. In analyzing the
problem, the system will consist of the projectile and the more massive
pendulum. As illustrated in the left image in
Fig. <a href="#M06Fig01" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="M06Fig01">1</a>, before the collision, the projectile is
in motion horizontally towards the stationary pendulum. After the
collision, the projectile is imbedded in the pendulum and the pendulum
is moving along the arc as shown in the right image of
Fig. <a href="#M06Fig01" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="M06Fig01">1</a>.

The horizontally launched brass ball collides rather violently with and
is captured by the more massive bob of the pendulum, initially at rest.
The violent collision is totally inelastic as the ball is captured by
the pendulum with much of the initial kinetic energy of the ball lost
through a variety of energy conversions, mostly heat.

During the collision of the ball with the pendulum, no external forces
are acting on the system. Newton’s third law demands that the forces of
the ball on the pendulum and the pendulum on the ball are equal and
opposite. These two, always equal and opposite, internal forces are
acting for the same time and therefore produce equal and opposite
impulses on the two bodies. Thus the change in momentum of one body is
equal and opposite to the change in momentum of the other. If the
momentum changes of the two colliding bodies are equal and opposite,
then the total linear momentum of the system cannot change and the total
momentum is conserved.

Notice that there has been no assumption on the nature of the internal
forces acting. They do not have to be elastic, i.e. conservative. As
such, the conservation of momentum does not imply anything about the
conservation of kinetic energy in the collision. Linear momentum is
conserved regardless of the nature of the interaction of the two bodies
during the collision. Only when the interactive forces are completely
elastic, i.e. conservative, will the kinetic energy of the collision be
conserved.

Momentum, like force and velocity, is a vector quantity. The
conservation of momentum of a system therefore implies the conservation
of the total vector momentum of the system. In our case, the initial
momentum of the system is the initial momentum of the brass ball, which
is only in the horizontal direction. Therefore the momentum after the
collision can only be in the horizontal direction and they must be
equal.

Thus we can write
*m**v⃗*<sub>0</sub> = (*m*+*M*)*V⃗*,
where *m* is the mass of the ball, *M* is the mass of the pendulum, and
*V⃗* is the velocity of the pendulum and ball together. If we can measure
or determine *V⃗*, we can determine *v⃗*<sub>0</sub>. The determination of
*V⃗* can be made by examining the motion of the pendulum after the
collision.

After the collision, the pendulum swings upward until it momentarily
comes to rest at the top of its swing where the vertical height of the
system has been increased from *y*<sub>1</sub> to *y*<sub>2</sub> (right
image of Fig. <a href="#M06Fig01" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="M06Fig01">1</a>). We will now make some assumptions. We
will assume that there are no friction losses in the motion of the
pendulum and that no collisions take place that might otherwise cause a
loss of mechanical energy. In other words, we are assuming that the
total mechanical energy of the system is conserved after the collision.
By equating the kinetic energy of the system just after the collision at
the bottom of the swing to the potential energy at the top, we can write
$$\\frac{1}{2}(m+M) V^2 = (m+M)  g \\left(y_2 - y_1\\right).$$
Solving this expression for *V* we have
$$V = \\sqrt{2 g \\left(y_2 - y_1\\right)}.$$

Substituting in Eqn. <a href="#eq:M06momentum" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:M06momentum">[eq:M06momentum]</a> above, we have
finally an expression for the initial velocity of the ball in terms of
the measurable change in height of the pendulum and the respective
masses, i.e.
$$\\label{eq:M06v0} 
  v_0 = \\left( \\frac{m+M}{m} \\right) \\sqrt{2 g \\left(y_2 - y_1\\right)}.$$

## Projectile Motion

When a projectile is moving solely under the influence of the force of
gravity, we say that the projectile is in free-fall. Consider the
launching of the same ball used in the ballistic pendulum. In this case,
the pendulum will be swung up out of the way so the flight of the ball
will continue off the edge of the table, eventually hitting the floor
some distance away. This situation is illustrated in
Fig. <a href="#M06Fig02" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="M06Fig02">2</a>.

Once the ball leaves the spring gun used to launch the ball, the ball is
in free-fall. The vertical and horizontal motions are completely
independent. We assume that once the ball leaves the gun, there are no
energy loss mechanisms during the flight of the ball.

In the vertical direction, the initial velocity is zero and the ball is
accelerated downward by its weight, finally hitting the floor some time,
*t*, later, dropping a vertical distance of *Y*. In the horizontal
direction, the ball has a constant velocity of *v*<sub>0</sub> during
the entire flight over the horizontal distance *X*.

Using our kinematic expressions for constant acceleration motion, we
have
$$Y = \\frac{1}{2} g t^2$$
and
*X* = *v*<sub>0</sub> *t*.
Eliminating the time *t* from these two expressions, we obtain
$$\\label{eq:M06v0pro}
  v_0 = X \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{2 Y}}.$$

        experiment including the mass of the ball *m*, the mass of the
        pendulum *M*, the initial pendulum height *y*<sub>1</sub> and
        any other common data needed for calculations.

    -   Create a table with a row for each of the ten trials in the
        ballistic pendulum part of this lab including the trial number,
        the pendulum height *y*<sub>2</sub>, the change in height
        *y*<sub>2</sub> − *y*<sub>1</sub>, the calculated velocity of
        the pendulum *V*, and the calculated initial velocity of the
        ball *v*<sub>0</sub>.

    -   Create a table to summarize the ten trials including the average
        pendulum height *y*<sub>2</sub>, the average change in height

        pendulum *V*, the average initial velocity of the ball
        *v*<sub>0</sub>, the standard deviation of *v*<sub>0</sub>.

2.  Measure and record the mass of the brass ball projectile.

3.  Record the mass of the pendulum that is indicated on the apparatus.

4.  Practice the following procedure before actually taking data.

5.  The pointer on the side of the bob indicates the center of mass of
    the pendulum. With the pendulum hanging motionless, measure the
    height above the base plate of the pointer. This value is
    *y*<sub>1</sub>. Record the value in meters.

6.  Place the brass ball on the pin of the gun and press the ball so the
    spring of the gun is compressed until the trigger catches and holds
    the compressed spring.

7.  Fire the gun by squeezing the trigger. The ball will be captured by
    the bob and the pendulum will swing upwards.

8.  A small ratchet engaging a rack will capture the maximum upswing
    position of the pendulum. Measure the height to the tip of the metal
    pointer on the pendulum which represents the center of mass of the
    pendulum with ball.

9.  Carefully release the ratchet so the pendulum can swing back to its
    equilibrium position.

10. Release the ball from the bob of the pendulum by pushing it with
    your finger or a short cylinder.

11. Fire the ball ten times, and record the pendulum height
    *y*<sub>2</sub> for each shot.

12. Calculate the average *y* = *y*<sub>2</sub> − *y*<sub>1</sub> and
    the average *v*<sub>0</sub> from
    Eqn. <a href="#eq:M06v0" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="eq:M06v0">[eq:M06v0]</a>.

13. Record your data and calculations on your spreadsheet.
