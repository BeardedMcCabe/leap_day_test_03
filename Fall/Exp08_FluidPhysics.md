# Background

Matter most commonly exists as a solid, liquid, or gas; these states are
known as the three common phases of matter. We will investigate liquids
in today’s experiments. While solids are rigid with specific shapes and
definite volumes where molecules are locked in position with their
neighbors, liquids and gases are considered to be fluids because they
are *not rigid* where the molecules are not locked in place and can
therefore flow (i.e. move with respect to each other).

In today’s experiments, we seek to understand why objects float or sink
in a liquid (water) using Archimedes Principle regarding fluid statics
as well as how liquid flows using Bernoulli’s Principle regarding fluid
dynamics.

## Archimedes’ Principle

Archimedes’ Principle states: “When an object is submerged in a fluid,
the fluid exerts an upwards buoyant force equal to the weight of the
fluid displaced by the object."

As depth increases, pressure in a fluid increases. Therefore, for an
object in a fluid, the upward force on the bottom of that object is
greater than the downward force on top of that object (see pressure
forces *F*<sub>down</sub> vs *F*<sub>up</sub> in
Fig. <a href="#M08_fluids_Fig01" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="M08_fluids_Fig01">1</a> *left*). There is a net upward
force, or **buoyant force**, on any object in any fluid. If the buoyant
force is greater than the object’s weight, the object will rise to the
surface and float. If the buoyant force is less than the object’s
weight, the object will sink (depicted in
Fig. <a href="#M08_fluids_Fig01" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="M08_fluids_Fig01">1</a> *right-a* with
*F*<sub>Buoyancy</sub> \< *w*<sub>object</sub>). If the buoyant force
equals the object’s weight, the object will remain suspended at that
depth. As such, there is always a buoyant force acting on an object
regardless of whether it floats, sinks, or remains suspended.

</div>

How could we determine the buoyancy force *F*<sub>B</sub> acting on the
object within the fluid? It helps to describe this by removing the
object (as in Fig. <a href="#M08_fluids_Fig01" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="M08_fluids_Fig01">1</a> *right-b*). The volume of the
space left behind is filled in by fluid having a weight
*w*<sub>fl</sub>. Since that fluid is supported by the surrounding
fluid, that weight of the fluid *w*<sub>fl</sub> (originally displaced
by the object) is equal to the buoyancy force *F*<sub>B</sub>. This is
**Archimedes’ Principle** — The buoyant force on an object equals the
weight of the fluid it displaces:

*F*<sub>B</sub> = *w*<sub>fl</sub>

<u>**First experiment (Archimedes)**</u>

In this experiment, we will first determine the mass, volume, and
density of 6 objects (see
Fig. <a href="#M08_fluids_Fig02" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="M08_fluids_Fig02">2</a>). We will then determine the
buoyant force acting on each object using Archimedes’ Principle by
determining the weight of water each object displaces. Finally, we will
determine the buoyant force by measuring the apparent weight of an
object.

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">3 cylinders, 2 blocks, 1

</div>

As a reminder, the density *ρ* of an object depends on its mass *m* and
volume *V*:

$$\\label{M08_fluids_Eq02}
    \\rho = \\frac{m}{V}$$

and the weight of an object is the downward force due to gravity:

*w*<sub>obj</sub> = *m**g*

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Left) Force diagram. Apparent weight in

sensor measuring apparent weight of object in water.</figcaption>
</figure>

</div>

When an object is submerged in a fluid, the apparent weight of the
object is less than the weight in air because of the upward buoyant
force (see Fig. <a href="#M08_fluids_Fig04" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="M08_fluids_Fig04">3</a>). Thus, the buoyant force can be
calculated by finding the difference between the weight of the object in
air and the apparent weight of the object when it is submerged in water.

*F*<sub>B</sub> = *w*<sub>obj in air</sub> − *w*<sub>obj in water</sub>

## Bernoulli’s Principle

Imagine fluid flowing through a channel of varying width (ex. of such a
setup in Fig. <a href="#M08_fluids_Fig07" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="M08_fluids_Fig07">4</a>. As the cross-sectional area
changes, the volumetric flow rate remains constant, but the velocity and
pressure of the fluid vary.

<div class="center">

<figure>
<img src="Fall/Experiment08Figures_Fluids/M08_fig07.png"
id="M08_fluids_Fig07" style="width:3.9in"
alt="Example of a Venturi tube, where velocity v_1 &lt; v_2, pressure P_1 &gt; P_2, and cross-sectional area A_1 &gt; A_2" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example of a Venturi tube, where velocity
<span
class="math inline"><em>v</em><sub>1</sub> &lt; <em>v</em><sub>2</sub></span>,

class="math inline"><em>P</em><sub>1</sub> &gt; <em>P</em><sub>2</sub></span>,
and cross-sectional area <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>1</sub> &gt; <em>A</em><sub>2</sub></span></figcaption>
</figure>

</div>

An incompressible fluid of density *ρ* flows through a pipe of varying
diameter. As the cross-sectional area decreases from *A*<sub>1</sub>
(large) to *A*<sub>2</sub> (small), the speed of the fluid increases
from *v*<sub>1</sub> to *v*<sub>2</sub>. The flow rate,
*R* = volume/time, of the fluid through the tube is related to the speed
of the fluid (*v* = distance/time) and the cross-sectional area of the
pipe *A*. The flow rate must be constant over the length of the pipe as
everything that goes in one side comes out the other end. This
relationship is known as the **Continuity Equation** which can be
expressed as:

*R* = *A*<sub>1</sub>*v*<sub>1</sub> = *A*<sub>2</sub>*v*<sub>2</sub>

As the fluid travels from the wide part of the pipe to the constriction,
the speed increases from *v*<sub>1</sub> to *v*<sub>2</sub>, and the
pressure decreases from *P*<sub>1</sub> to *P*<sub>2</sub>. This drop in
fluid pressure due to fluid speeding up as it flows through a
constricted section of a pipe is known as the **Venturi effect**. This
effect can be created with the use of a Venturi tube which allows an
incompressible fluid to flow from a wider to narrower section with
minimal turbulence.

Assuming the path an incompressible fluid takes is frictionless with no
viscous forces, then the energy of the fluid is conserved. The fluid can
be analyzed by the total work done on the fluid from the initial
position to final position within the tube (total change in both kinetic
and potential energy). The full derivation is in your lecture textbook,
but for now, we arrive at **Bernoulli’s Equation**. For an
**incompressible, frictionless fluid**, the combination of pressure and
the sum of kinetic and potential energy densities is *constant* not only
over time, but also along a streamline:

$$\\label{M08_fluids_Eq06}
    P + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 + \\rho g y = \\text{constant}$$

Note the similarities in
Eqn. <a href="#M08_fluids_Eq06" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="M08_fluids_Eq06">[M08_fluids_Eq06]</a> to our previous
labs’ equations for kinetic and potential energies ($\\frac{1}{2}m v^2$
& *m**g**h*). Applying this to our Venturi tube of
Fig. <a href="#M08_fluids_Fig07" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="M08_fluids_Fig07">4</a>:

$$\\label{M08_fluids_Eq07}
    P_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v\_{1}^2 + \\rho g y_1 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v\_{2}^2 + \\rho g y_2$$

However, since our tube will be horizontal, we can remove the height
dependence and our pressure change is due only to the velocity change
(noted by the Continuity Equation in
Eqn. <a href="#M08_fluids_Eq05" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="M08_fluids_Eq05">[M08_fluids_Eq05]</a>). Thus, our
equation simplifies to **Bernoulli’s Principle** of fluid flow at a
**constant height**:

$$\\label{M08_fluids_Eq08}
    P_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v\_{1}^2 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v\_{2}^2$$

Rearranged another way to determine the pressure at the constriction:

$$\\label{M08_fluids_Eq08}
    P_2 = P_1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\rho (v\_{2}^2 - v\_{1}^2)$$

<u>**Second experiment (Bernoulli)**</u>

In our experiment, we will assume we don’t know the pressure at the
constriction *P*<sub>2</sub>, and will use the Continuity and Bernoulli
equations to determine theoretically what *P*<sub>2</sub> theoretical
should be and compare to the actual value *P*<sub>2</sub> actual as
measure by our pressure sensor.

The setup will be as in
Fig. <a href="#M08_fluids_Fig08" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="M08_fluids_Fig08">5</a>. Water can be released from the
pitcher sitting on the white/plexiglass box with the cooler-style spout
as the release valve. On the other end of the water hose will be a hose
clamp for use during the determination of the flow-rate to rapidly stop
the flow of water (if you only used the spout at the pitcher, much of
the water would continue flowing out of the tube even after shutting if
off, messing up the flow-rate calculations).

*P*<sub>1</sub>, as measured by the Quad Pressure Sensor, will be
treated as a known actual or accepted value to be used in our
calculations to solve for *P*<sub>2 theoretical</sub>. It will be
connected to port 1 (or port 3 if in the future these sensors break).

We will calculate *P*<sub>2 theoretical</sub> from our Continuity and
Bernoulli equations. The value of *P*<sub>2, actual</sub>, as measured
by the Quad Pressure Sensor, will be treated as the known actual value
to compare to. *P*<sub>2</sub> will be connected to port 2 (or port 4 if
sensor is damaged).

NOTE: The pressure sensor hoses are to have only (or mostly) air such
that water does not reach the pressure sensor. To avoid water getting up
the air hoses, ensure the Venturi tube is positioned with the air hoses
pointed upward. After passing through the Venturi tube, the water will
flow into a catch basin. There will also be a stopwatch to measure
flow-rate during the first part of the experiment.

If you require more water in your pitcher, use another pitcher to refill
(assuming the catch basin is glass, there will be less of a chance of
that breaking if we’re not moving it around more than we have to).

# Experimental Procedure

## Archimedes’ Principle (First experiment)

1.  **OVERALL GOALS:**

    -   Understand the relationship between buoyancy force and the mass,
        volume, density of an object.

    -   Determine buoyant force using Archimedes’ Principle.

    -   Determine buoyant force by measuring the upward force directly.

    <u>**Part I: Mass, Volume, and Density**</u>

2.  Create a data table with:

    -   Columns for the mass *m*, relevant dimensions (length, width,
        height, radius), volume *V*, and density *ρ*

    -   Rows for each of the 6 objects (clearly label or describe the
        objects in the table).

3.  Using the triple-beam balance, find the mass of each of the six
    objects. List the objects in order from least to greatest mass.
    *Consider: are any of the masses nearly the same?*

4.  Using the calipers, measure the dimensions of the 3 cylinders and
    the 2 blocks
    (Fig. <a href="#M08_fluids_Fig03" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="M08_fluids_Fig03">6</a>). Remember to divide the
    diameter by 2 to get the radius, *r*. Calculate the volume *V* of
    these objects *V*<sub>cylinder</sub> = *π**r*<sup>2</sup>*h* and
    *V*<sub>block</sub> = *l**w**h*

5.  There is no simple formula for the volume of the irregularly shaped
    object, so it is necessary to find the volume by measuring the
    volume of water it displaces:

    -   Put the beaker under the overflow can spout as shown in
        Fig. <a href="#M08_fluids_Fig03" data-reference-type="ref"
        data-reference="M08_fluids_Fig03">6</a>.

    -   Pour water into the overflow can until it overflows into the
        beaker. Allow the water to stop overflowing on its own and empty
        the beaker into your pitcher and return it to its position under
        the overflow can spout without jarring the overflow can.

    -   Tie a string on the irregular object.

    -   Gently lower the irregular object into the overflow can until it
        is completely submerged. Allow the water to stop overflowing and
        then pour the water from the beaker into the graduated cylinder.
        Measure the volume of water that was displaced by reading the
        water level in the graduated cylinder in milliliters (1 ml = 1
        cm<sup>3</sup>)

    <div class="center">

    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Left) Measuring with calipers. Right)
    Lowering object into overflow can.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    </div>

6.  List the 6 objects in order from least to greatest volume.
    *Consider: Is this the same order as the mass list? Are any of the
    volumes nearly the same?*

7.  Calculate the density of each object. List the 6 objects in order
    from least to greatest density. *Consider: Is this list in the same
    order as either the mass list or the volume list? Do any of the
    objects have densities that are nearly the same?*

8.  Group the objects according to the type of material of which they
    are made. *Consider: In which list (mass, volume, or density) are
    the objects grouped similarly?*

    <u>**Part II: Finding the Buoyant Force Using Archimedes’
    Principle**</u>

    For each of the objects, find the weight of the water displaced by
    each one:

9.  Create a data table with:

    -   Mass of beaker and other common data

    -   Columns for the mass
        *m*<sub>water</sub> = *m*<sub>total</sub> − *m*<sub>beaker</sub>,
        weight
        *w*<sub>water</sub> = *m*<sub>water</sub>*g* = *F*<sub>B</sub>

    -   Rows for each of the 6 objects plus a half-submerged brass
        cylinder (so 7 rows). Clearly label or describe the objects in
        the table.

10. Find the mass of the beaker. Put the beaker under the overflow can
    spout as shown in
    Fig. <a href="#M08_fluids_Fig03" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="M08_fluids_Fig03">6</a>.

11. Pour water into the overflow can until it overflows into the beaker.
    Allow the water to stop overflowing on its own and empty the beaker
    into the pitcher and return it to its position under the overflow
    can spout without jarring the overflow can.

12. Tie a string onto each of the objects.

13. Gently lower the first object into the overflow can until it is
    completely submerged. Allow the water to stop overflowing. Find the
    mass of the water plus beaker. Subtract the mass of the beaker to
    determine the mass of the displaced water. Multiply the mass by the
    acceleration due to gravity (9.803 m/s<sup>2</sup>) to find the
    weight of the water.

14. Repeat this procedure for the other objects. Note that the plastic
    cylinder will float so don’t try to completely submerge it in the
    water. Also find the weight of the displaced water when only half
    the brass cylinder is submerged.

15. List the objects in order from least buoyant force to greatest
    buoyant force. *Consider: Is this in the same order as the mass
    list, the volume list, or the density list? Are any of the buoyant
    forces nearly the same? Why or why not?*

    <u>**Part III: Finding the Buoyant Force by Finding the Upward
    Force**</u>

16. Create a data table:

    -   Seven rows for each of the 6 objects as well as the brass
        cylinder half-submerged (clearly label or describe the objects
        in the table).

    -   Columns for weight in air *w*<sub>obj in air</sub>, apparent
        weight in water *w*<sub>obj in water</sub>, buoyant force
        *F*<sub>B</sub> as determined with
        Eqn. <a href="#M08_fluids_Eq04" data-reference-type="ref"
        data-reference="M08_fluids_Eq04">[M08_fluids_Eq04]</a>.

17. Tie a loop on the other end of the string so it can be hooked onto
    the force sensor.

18. In Capstone, press record or monitor, and you will see the force in
    Newtons displayed (constantly updating). You can let this continue
    running to act as a continuous scale.

19. Before hanging any of the objects on the force sensor hook, zero the
    force sensor with the physical “zero" button on the front of the
    force sensor (shown in
    Fig. <a href="#M08_fluids_Fig04" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="M08_fluids_Fig04">3</a>).

20. With the water out of the way, record the weight of each object in
    air *w*<sub>air</sub> by hanging them on the hook.

21. Zero the sensor as needed if it appears to be drifting when swapping
    out the different objects.

22. Now place the pitcher of water beneath the force sensor such that
    when you hang each object from the force sensor hook, the objects
    can be fully submerged. Record the apparent weight of each object in
    water *w*<sub>water</sub>.

23. Calculate the buoyant force for each object by taking the difference
    between the weight in air and the weight in water
    (Eqn. <a href="#M08_fluids_Eq04" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="M08_fluids_Eq04">[M08_fluids_Eq04]</a>).

24. Add an additional column and calculate for each object case the %
    difference between the buoyancy force (found here by measuring the
    upward force) and the buoyancy force found previously by Archimedes’
    Principle of the displaced water.

    $\\% \\text{ diff.} = \\frac{F\_\\text{B, upward force method} - F\_\\text{B, Archimedes' method}}{F\_\\text{B, Archimedes' method}} \\times 100$

    *Consider: In each case, is the buoyant force that was determined
    using the upward force equal to the weight of the water displaced?*

## Bernoulli’s Principle (Second experiment)

1.  **OVERALL GOALS:**

    -   Understand fluid-flow continuity through different
        constrictions.

    -   Determine flow-rate of our system using the Continuity Equation.

    -   Understand Bernoulli’s Principle of fluid flow at a constant
        height to investigate the Venturi effect and determine the
        pressure of a fluid at a constriction point (in a Venturi tube).

    <u>**Part I: Determining Flow Rate *R***</u>

2.  Create a data table:

    -   6 rows for five trials of the measuring flow rate as well as the
        average flow rate *R*<sub>avg</sub> and standard deviation of
        your flow rate *σ*<sub>*R*</sub>.

    -   Columns for the volume *Δ**V* of water, elapsed time *Δ**t* it
        took to flow, and flow rate *R*.

3.  With water in the pitcher, open the release-valve (spout) to allow
    water to flow and remove most of any air bubbles within the tubing.
    After a couple seconds, tighten the hose clamp at the end to halt
    the flow. Take whatever water is in the catch basin and return it to
    the pitcher.

4.  Start current trial with the catch basin empty.

5.  Start the stopwatch and open the hose clamp at the same time to
    start water flow.

6.  After a measurable amount of water has flowed through, stop the
    stopwatch and close the hose clamp at the same time.

7.  Measure the volume of water that flowed out of (or into) the
    apparatus (either with the scale on the catch basin or graduated
    cylinder).

8.  Calculate the average flow rate for the current trial
    $R = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta t}$ where *Δ**V* is the volume of
    water and *Δ**t* is the elapsed time.

9.  Empty the catch basin or graduated cylinder back into the pitcher to
    keep a consistent amount of water in it.

10. Rerun this process starting with the empty catch basin (assuming the
    water hose is still clear of air bubbles) 4 more times for a total
    of 5 trials.

11. From the individual trial flow rates, calculate the average flow
    rate *R*<sub>avg</sub> and standard deviation *σ*<sub>*R*</sub>
    which we will use to represent our uncertainty in the flow rate
    (*R*<sub>avg</sub> ± *σ*<sub>*R*</sub>).

12. NOTE: Typically the flow rate varies with the level of water in the
    reservoir. To keep the flow rate close to constant, make the
    pressure measurements with the water level approximately the same as
    it was for the flow rate measurement.

    <u>**Part II: Determining Pressure at a Constriction**</u>

    <u>**with Continuity and Bernoulli Eqns.**</u>

13. Create a data table:

    -   Common data section including:

        -   Flow rate *R*<sub>avg</sub> ± *σ*<sub>*R*</sub> from Part I.

        -   Cross-sectional areas *A*<sub>1</sub> and *A*<sub>2</sub>
            and their uncertainties *δ*<sub>*A*<sub>1</sub></sub> and
            *δ*<sub>*A*<sub>2</sub></sub>.

        -   Velocities *v*<sub>1</sub> and *v*<sub>2</sub>. Also include
            the max values for each (Used to estimate pressure
            uncertainty later).

        -   Density of water *ρ* (use 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>)

    -   7 rows for five trials of the measuring *P*<sub>1</sub> and
        *P*<sub>2</sub> in Capstone as well as their averages
        *P*<sub>1 avg actual</sub> and *P*<sub>2 avg actual</sub> and
        standard deviations *σ*<sub>*P*<sub>1 avg actual</sub></sub> and
        *σ*<sub>*P*<sub>2 avg actual</sub></sub>.

    -   Columns for *P*<sub>1</sub> and *P*<sub>2</sub>.

14. Determine the cross-sectional areas of the wide and narrow
    constrictions (*A*<sub>1</sub> and *A*<sub>2</sub> respectively)
    with the calipers from the cutaway version of the Venturi tubes
    (*A* = *π**r*<sup>2</sup>). Note your uncertainty due to your
    measurement precision (*δ*<sub>*A*<sub>1</sub></sub> and
    *δ*<sub>*A*<sub>2</sub></sub>).

15. Calculate *v*<sub>1</sub> and *v*<sub>2</sub> with the Continuity
    Eqn. <a href="#M08_fluids_Eq05" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="M08_fluids_Eq05">[M08_fluids_Eq05]</a> based on your
    measured areas and average flow rate. Similarly, calculate
    *v*<sub>1 max</sub> and *v*<sub>2 max</sub> by maximizing the flow
    rate (*R*<sub>avg</sub> + *σ*<sub>*R*</sub>) and minimizing the
    areas (e.g. *A*<sub>1</sub> − *δ*<sub>*A*<sub>1</sub></sub>).

16. Capstone will be set up to show two pressures representing
    *P*<sub>1</sub> and *P*<sub>2</sub>. Double check the the pressure
    taps of the Venturi tube are appropriately connected like in
    Fig. <a href="#M08_fluids_Fig08" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="M08_fluids_Fig08">5</a> where Channel 1 is connected
    to the wider part of the Venturi tube, and Channel 2 to the narrow
    constriction of the Venturi tube. (It’ll be easier to keep track of
    which pressure is which when the labels are similar.)

17. Capstone will also show a plot with both *P*<sub>1</sub> and
    *P*<sub>2</sub> on the y-axis as a function of time on the x-axis.
    To analyze either data set later on, you can click directly on the
    plotted data.

18. Calibrate the pressure sensor by:

    -   Ensure both the hose clamp and release valve (spout) are closed.

    -   Disconnect the air hoses from the Quad Pressure Sensor via the
        quick connectors so the pressure sensors are open to atmospheric
        pressure. Set the air hoses on top of the white box (or in a
        bracket to hold them if I get them prepared in time) so the end
        of the hose is above the spout water level to prevent water from
        siphoning through the air hoses.

    -   In Capstone, select the green Calibration tab on the left-hand
        panel.

    -   1\) Pressure 2) Select all “Pressure Measurements" 3) Type of
        Calibration as “One Standard (1 point offset)" 4) Set Standard
        Value to average atmospheric pressure of 101.3 kPa — Click the
        "Set Current Value to Standard Value" button 5) Finish

    -   Both Absolute Pressure Channels 1 and 2, when you press record,
        should now read at about 101.3 kPa, if not, retry the
        calibration.

19. Ensure no water is near the end of the air hoses to prevent any
    water getting into the pressure sensors. Reconnect the air hoses to
    the pressure sensors.

20. You can open the hose clamp at the end of the hose as it will not be
    needed for the rest of this experiment. You will just need to catch
    basin to collect the water and avoid making a mess.

21. Press record, then open the release valve to allow the water to flow
    into the catch basin. After any air bubbles have passed and the
    water is flowing with minimal turbulence, continue recording
    pressure data for ∼<!-- -->5 seconds, then close the release valve
    (spout) and stop recording. <span id="M08_fluids_BernoulliStep_00"

22. Find the section of your Pressure vs. Time plot where flow was
    laminar (smooth without bubbles), should be a generally flat section
    of the Pressure vs Time plot. Click on the *P*<sub>1</sub> data on
    the plot, enable the highlight tool, and select a chunk of the plot
    when flow was laminar (no bubbles, the flat part). Do the same for
    the *P*<sub>2</sub> data. You can find the average value for
    *P*<sub>1</sub> and *P*<sub>2</sub> at the bottom of the table on
    the left hand side of your screen, where the mean is representing
    the average value of whichever subset of the data you’ve
    highlighted.

23. Record both *P*<sub>1 actual</sub> and *P*<sub>2 actual</sub>. There
    should be a difference of  ∼ 2–5kPa, if not, double check with an
    instructor.

24. Rerun this process from
    Step <a href="#M08_fluids_BernoulliStep_00" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="M08_fluids_BernoulliStep_00">[M08_fluids_BernoulliStep_00]</a>
    an additional 4 times for a total of 5 trials.

25. Determine the *P*<sub>1 avg actual</sub> and
    *P*<sub>2 avg actual</sub> values from your five trials. Also
    determine their standard deviations
    *σ*<sub>*P*<sub>1 avg actual</sub></sub> and
    *σ*<sub>*P*<sub>2 avg actual</sub></sub>.

26. Calculate your theoretical value of *P*<sub>2 theoretical</sub> with
    Eqn. <a href="#M08_fluids_Eq08" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="M08_fluids_Eq08">[M08_fluids_Eq08]</a> using your
    previously determined velocities *v*<sub>1</sub> and *v*<sub>2</sub>
    and your average *P*<sub>1 avg actual</sub> treated as the known
    actual value for the wider part of the Venturi tube.

27. Similarly calculate your max theoretical value of
    *P*<sub>2, max theoretical</sub> by maximizing
    *P*<sub>1 avg actual</sub> (e.g.
    *P*<sub>1 avg actual</sub> + *σ*<sub>*P*<sub>1 avg actual</sub></sub>)
    and using your already determined maximized velocities
    *v*<sub>1 max</sub> and *v*<sub>2 max</sub>.

28. Represent your uncertainty *δ**P*<sub>2 theoretical</sub> with the
    difference of your maximized value and average values (e.g.
    *δ**P*<sub>2 theoretical</sub> = *P*<sub>2, max theoretical</sub> − *P*<sub>2 theoretical</sub>).

29. *Consider:* Does you theoretical value for *P*<sub>2</sub> agree
    with the actual value of *P*<sub>2</sub> as measured with the
    pressure sensor?

# Post-Lab Submission — Interpretation of Results

## Archimedes’ Principle (First experiment)

-   Make sure to submit your finalized data table (Excel sheet)

-   First Experiment (Archimedes’ Principle)

    -   In which list (mass, volume, or density) are the objects grouped
        similarly?

    -   In each object case, is the buoyant force that was determined
        using the upward force (Part III) equal to the weight of the
        water displaced (Part II)? Were the % differences between the
        two methods for each case relatively small, or did any case
        standout?

    -   Which objects had the same buoyant force when submerged? Why?

    -   For the plastic cylinder, what was the apparent weight in water?
        What would be the buoyant force be if plastic cylinder were
        completely submerged?

    -   How did the buoyant force for the totally submerged brass
        cylinder relate to the buoyant force for the half-submerged
        brass cylinder?

    -   What does the buoyant force depend on: The mass of the object,
        or its volume, or its density, or the material from which it is
        made?

-   Second Experiment (Bernoulli’s Principle)

    -   Does you theoretical value for *P*<sub>2</sub> agree with the
        actual value of *P*<sub>2</sub> as measured with the pressure
        sensor? (i.e.
        *P*<sub>2 theoretical</sub> ± *δ**P*<sub>2 theoretical</sub>
        overlap with
        *P*<sub>2 avg actual</sub> ± *σ**P*<sub>2 avg actual</sub>?)

    -   How is the Bernoulli Principle different than the Bernoulli
        Equation?

    -   What assumptions about the fluid allows the Bernoulli Principle
        to work? (i.e. what type or characteristics of the fluid and/or
        flow are necessary assumptions for Bernoulli to hold true?)

    -   Imagine that instead of being on the table, the Venturi tube
        were set on the floor with the rest of the experimental
        apparatus unchanged. Would the difference in pressures we see on
        the Capstone plot between *P*<sub>1</sub> and *P*<sub>2</sub>
        during the smooth, laminar flow section that we analyzed to find
        average pressures be *larger*, *smaller*, or *the same*. Why?
