# Background

**Energy cannot be created nor destroyed.** All that can really happen
is a change in its form. We shall consider the conservation of
mechanical energy, in particular, the sum of the kinetic energy and
potential energy of a mass. The kinetic energy is due to the motion of
the mass and the potential energy is due to the relative position of the
mass in the earth’s gravitational field. This total mechanical energy
can only change if nonconservative forces are acting on any part of the
system. We will examine the exchange of kinetic and potential energy and
the conservation of mechanical energy under the presumption of no
nonconservative forces acting. If the mechanical energy is not conserved
we will attempt to determine potential sources of nonconservative work
being done that would change the mechanical energy.

The **work** done by a force acting on a mass is the magnitude of the
force acting in the direction of motion times the distance the mass
moves. Work is only done when the mass moves. (In other words, you can
push as hard as you like on a brick wall, but if the wall doesn’t move,
you didn’t do any work!) Assume for the moment that we have a mass *m*
moving on a frictionless, horizontal surface. Assume a force acts on the
mass from the position *x* = 0 to *x* = *x*<sub>1</sub> as illustrated
in Fig. <a href="#M05Fig01" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="M05Fig01">1</a>. At position *x* = 0 it is moving with a
velocity *v*<sub>0</sub> and at *x* = *x*<sub>1</sub> the velocity is
*v*<sub>1</sub>.

The work done by the force is $W_F = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{x_1}$. Using
Newton’s second law it can easily be shown that the work done by the
force changes a quantity we call the *kinetic energy*,
$K = \\nicefrac{1}{2} m v^2$. Using the example illustrated in
Fig. <a href="#M05Fig01" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="M05Fig01">1</a>,
$$\\vec{F} \\cdot (\\vec{x}\_1 - \\vec{0}) =
\\frac{1}{2} m \\,{v_1}^2 -  \\frac{1}{2} m \\,{v_0}^{2}.$$
In this case, the force is acting in the direction of the motion and
thereby increases the kinetic energy. If the force were acting in the
direction opposite to the motion, then the kinetic energy would be
decreased. If friction were present, it would act in the direction
opposite to the direction of motion and thereby reduce the kinetic
energy. In this simple analysis, we have made no assumption as to the
nature of the force.

A force like friction is a non-conservative force. The work done by it
not only depends upon the path the mass takes but is also not completely
recoverable. However, the work done on a mass by a conservative force
can be completely returned to the mass as mechanical energy. Thus work
done by a conservative force can be represented by a potential energy
function and depends only on the end points of the process. The
gravitational force is a conservative force and is assumed constant in
the vicinity of the surface of the earth. The potential energy function
is merely the work done by gravity on the way up or the way down and is
equal to the gravitational force (the weight *m**g*) times the change in
height, *h*. The gravitational potential energy, *U*, is given by
*U* = *m**g**h*.
The work done by this conservative force, like all conservative forces,
only depends on the end-points of the path. The gravitational potential
energy is a relative quantity, i.e. it is a change in energy because of
a change in elevation. Thus we can choose a zero level arbitrarily.

If there are no non-conservative forces acting, then a mass moving only
under the influence of gravity merely exchanges its kinetic and
potential energy while the total energy remains constant. For a mass
stationary at some height, *h*, above the ground, all of its energy is
potential energy of value *m**g**h* with respect to the ground. As the
mass begins to fall under the influence of gravity, it loses *U* and
gains *K* When it reaches the ground, the *U* is zero with respect to
the ground and the *K* is a maximum, equal to the original *U* at the
top. If the mass were a roller coaster, the coaster could climb back up
to its original height where all the energy would be *U* at which point
it would momentarily stop, i.e. no *K*. This assumes that neither
friction nor any other nonconservative force is acting. In general, we
have
Work done by non-conservative Forces = *W*<sub>*N*.*C*.</sub> = *Δ**K* + *Δ**U*.
If there are no non-conservative forces acting, then
*Δ**K* + *Δ**U* = 0.

In this experiment, we will use an air track to provide a nearly
frictionless surface. The track will be tilted at a measurable angle. A
glider will be released from rest at the top of the track and allowed to
slide down and collide with a spring at the bottom. If the force of the
spring on the glider is conservative, then the kinetic energy of the
glider at the bottom is converted to potential energy in the compressed
spring. This potential energy is given back to the glider in the form of
kinetic energy as the spring expands. The glider bounces off and goes
back up the track to its original height where the energy is again all
*U*. If no energy is lost in the collision at the bottom, we say that
the collision is completely elastic, implying that the forces involved
in the collision are conservative. After the collision, the glider will
rebound up the track. Getting back to its original height therefore
implies no mechanical energy is lost during the entire path. If it does
not, we have to look for an energy loss mechanism and some
non-conservative forces acting.

The change in height from the top to the bottom is measured allowing the
change in *U* to be calculated. We will set the zero level for the
potential energy at the bottom of track, at the position,
*s*<sub>0</sub>, in Fig. <a href="#M05Fig02" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="M05Fig02">2</a>.

A measurement of the transit time from the top to the bottom will allow
the calculation of the velocity at the bottom and therefore the *K* at
the bottom. Finally, measuring the maximum height achieved on the
rebound will yield a second value of *U*

The *K* at the bottom of the track can be determined by measuring the
average velocity from the release point at the top, *s*<sub>1</sub>, to
the collision point at the bottom, *s*<sub>0</sub>, and then using
Equation 1. From a measurement of the transit time from *s*<sub>1</sub>
to *s*<sub>0</sub>, the velocity of the glider at the moment of
collision at the bottom, *v*<sub>*b*</sub>, can be determined by using
the definition of average velocity, *v*<sub>*a**v**g*</sub>, thus:
$$\\frac{\\Delta s}{\\Delta t}  = v\_{\\mbox{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2} (v\_{b}+v_1)$$
where the initial velocity, *v*<sub>1</sub> = 0, *Δ**s* is the distance
traveled down the track, and *Δ**t* is the transit time of travel.

Rearranging terms we have the velocity at the bottom in terms of
measurable quantities
*v*<sub>*b*</sub> = 2*v*<sub>avg</sub> = 2(*Δ**s*/*Δ**t*).
Using the definition of *K*, the *K* at the bottom is then
$$K_b = \\frac{1}{2} m\\, {v_b}^2.$$

In order to calculate the potential energy, *U* at any point, along the
track we must determine the change in height between *s*<sub>1</sub> and
*s*<sub>0</sub>. The potential energy at any position along the track is
measured with respect to the collision point at the bottom,
*s*<sub>0</sub>, which is arbitrarily assigned a value of zero potential
energy. The *U* is given by the weight of the glider, *m**g*, times the
change in vertical height.

Fig. <a href="#M05Fig02" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="M05Fig02">2</a> is a simplified diagram of the inclined
track. The distance *s* is measured along the track by the scale
attached to the side of the track. The change in elevation, *Δ**h*, of
any other point *s* along the track can now be determined from the
distance *s* and the incline angle of track, *θ*. The incline of the
track is produced by placing a spacer of known height under a leg at one
end. With the height of the spacer and the distance between the legs,
*D*, the angle can be calculated (See
Fig. <a href="#M05Fig03" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="M05Fig03">3</a>).

At *s*<sub>0</sub>, *U*<sub>*b*</sub> = 0, therefore
*U*<sub>*s*</sub> = *m**g* *Δ**h* = *m**g* *Δ**s*sin (*θ*). Referring to

With the very small angles of incline being used, we can safely assume
that
tan (*θ*) ∼ sin (*θ*),
therefore the potential energy, *U*, at some position, *s*, along the
track is finally given by measurable quantities as
$$U_s = mg \\, \\Delta s \\frac{H}{D}.$$

-   Turn on the air and allow it to run a couple of minutes before
    proceeding. It is very important that the track is clean and free of
    dirt. This will prevent any damage to the very expensive air track
    and will keep friction to an absolute minimum. Do not put a glider
    on the track without air flowing.

-   Measure and record the mass of both a large and a small glider.

-   Without the spacer present and the air track resting directly on the
    tabletop, place one of the gliders on the track and note any
    preferential drift of the glider. Adjust the height of the single
    leg until the air track is level, as indicated by no preferential
    drift. Check both orientations of the glider on the track to check
    if the car is asymmetric and has a significant preferential drift on
    an otherwise level track. If this occurs, use another glider.

-   Measure and record the distance *D*. This is the center-to-center
    distance between the legs.

-   Measure and record the heights *H*, of each of the two spacers. Use
    a Vernier caliper for maximum accuracy. See the instructions at
    Fig. <a href="#VernierFig02" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="VernierFig02">[VernierFig02]</a> for using the
    Vernier caliper.

-   Four cases will be performed, two gliders for two spacers. Determine
    a convenient point on the glider to use with the scale attached on
    the side of track. It doesn’t matter what point you choose, only
    that you use the same point for all *s* determinations for that
    glider. A convenient point is the lower front or rear corner of the
    glider since it will be very close to the scale.

-   For each case, perform the following steps and record the data
    appropriately in your spreadsheet:

    1.  Raise the single leg side of the track by placing a spacer under
        the knob.

    2.  Place the glider at the bottom of the track resting against the
        bumper. Record *s*<sub>0</sub>. (Note: With the car at this
        position, the red light on the bottom photogate should be lit.
        Moving the glider to the right the slightest distance should put
        the light out. If this is not the case, adjust the position of
        the photogate.)

    3.  Next, place the glider near the top of the track. Move it slowly
        as you approach the top photogate. Stop the glider at the exact
        location when the red light comes on. Record *s*<sub>1</sub>.

    4.  Before you take the recorded data in the next step, take some
        practice runs. Your subsequent data will be much improved by
        your training!

        -   Position the glider so it is blocking the top photogate and
            the red light is on. Place one finger on the track in front
            of the glider and gently push the glider to the right until
            the red light on the photogate just goes out.

        -   Press record in **Capstone** to start the timer. *NOTE:*
            **Capstone** may take a few seconds to start displaying
            times, once it’s going, it will display the time whenever a
            photogate beam is broken; the time at the higher (start)
            photogate *t*<sub>1</sub> as well as the time at the lower
            (end) photogate *t*<sub>0</sub>. Total transit time *Δ**t*
            will be the the difference of the start and end times.

        -   Release the glider by quickly pulling your finger away from
            the track. After the glider bounces off the lower bumper,
            you can calculate the time of travel from top to bottom
            *Δ**t*.

    5.  For each of the five trials, release the glider from the
        *s*<sub>1</sub> point and measure and record the following:

        -   The transit time *Δ**t* from release at the top to the
            collision at the bottom. Release the glider very carefully
            to insure that the initial velocity is zero.

        -   Allowing the glider to rebound off the bumper, record the
            rebound position *s*<sub>2</sub>. As the glider slows to a
            stop, capture the glider by gently pressing your finger near
            a lower corner of the glider just as it comes to a stop and
            then read *s*<sub>2</sub> off the scale. Use the same point
            on the glider to read *s*<sub>2</sub> that you used to read
            *s*<sub>1</sub> and *s*<sub>0</sub>.

**Data Table:**

-   Create a table of the common data including the masses of the
    gliders, the distance *D* between the legs of the air track and the
    heights of the two spacers.

    including:

    -   % change from initial potential energy to final potential energy

    Calculate the following:

    -   For each case, calculate the initial potential energy at
        *s*<sub>1</sub>. Average the transit times, *Δ**t*, and
        calculate the velocity *v*<sub>*b*</sub> and the
        *K*<sub>*b*</sub>.

    -   For each case, average the rebound position, *s*<sub>2</sub>.
        Using this averaged value, calculate the final *U*<sub>2</sub>.
